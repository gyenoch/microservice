# Production-Grade Microservices with DevSecOps 🌐

## Project Description 📝
This project demonstrates the integration of DevSecOps principles—seamlessly combining development, security, and operations throughout the software lifecycle. By leveraging cloud and DevOps tools, this project outlines how to build, deploy, and maintain microservices efficiently using best practices and automation.

## Project Overview 🚀
This project showcases a production-grade setup using:
🛠️ **Tools Explored:**
- **AWS EKS** for scalable container orchestration
- **GitLab CI/CD** for automated pipelines
- **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Snyk & Trivy** for vulnerability scanning
- **SonarQube** for code quality analysis
- **ArgoCD** for GitOps-based deployments
- **Prometheus & Grafana** for real-time monitoring and alerting

These tools, combined with robust DevSecOps practices, ensure that microservices are securely deployed, monitored, and managed at scale.

## CI/CD Pipeline Stages 🔄

1. **Infrastructure Provisioning** with Terraform for consistent, automated setup of AWS resources.
2. **Code Quality Analysis** using SonarQube to enforce best practices and maintain a clean codebase.
3. **Dependency Scanning** with Snyk to identify and remediate known vulnerabilities.
4. **Container Image Scanning** using Trivy to secure Docker images before deployment.
5. **Continuous Delivery** managed with GitLab CI/CD, deploying to EKS through ArgoCD and GitOps.
6. **Autoscaling Setup** with Cluster Autoscaler in EKS, allowing dynamic resource allocation based on real-time needs.

## Outcomes 🎉

- **Automated EKS Setup**: Infrastructure and essential Kubernetes services (like ArgoCD, Prometheus, and Grafana) are set up and managed through automation, providing consistency and ease.
- **GitOps Workflow**: ArgoCD’s "App of Apps" model simplifies management of multiple microservices.
- **Secure Deployment**: Integration of Snyk, Trivy, and SonarQube ensures code and dependencies are vulnerability-free and production-ready.
- **Dynamic Scaling**: EKS Cluster Autoscaler optimizes resources and costs by adjusting node counts based on demand.
- **Robust Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana provide real-time insights and alerting, keeping the system healthy and responsive.

With this setup, you're equipped with a resilient, scalable, and secure framework for microservices. This project combines automation, monitoring, and continuous security to bring the best of DevSecOps practices to microservices architecture.
